    <center>Hello, Everyone our Nikah was held on April 9th, im sorry that I could not<br>
    invite everyone to the Nikah since it was a small event.  I made this so that<br>
    all of you can see the pictures that were taken and make fun of me for looking
    like a total derp. Thank you everyone!</center>
